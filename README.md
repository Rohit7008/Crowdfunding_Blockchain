# My Notes

This project was very helpful to me in my smart contract journey and it's a pleasure contributing to it.

I will start with changing the network from Goerli to sepolia testnet as Goerli now requires you to have real ETH to use it.

### Steps for changing to Sepolia Testnet

- Update the hardhat.config.js file and deploy - `npx thirdweb deploy`
- Copy the contract address on thirdweb and update it on `client/context/index.js`
- Update `main.jsx`.
