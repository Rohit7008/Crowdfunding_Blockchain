/*CODE EXPLANATION:
This is a smart contract written in the Solidity programming language for a crowdfunding platform on the Ethereum blockchain. 
It allows users to create campaigns with a title, description, target amount, deadline, and image. It also allows users to donate 
to campaigns and provides a function to view the list of all campaigns and their details, as well as the list of donators and the amounts they donated. 
The contract uses a mapping to store the campaigns, with each campaign being assigned a unique identifier (ID). The number of campaigns is stored in the 
"numberOfCampaigns" variable.
